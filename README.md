## News 

I'm changing the update system to make it easier and more efficient. This change should affect only new installations, not older ones. New installs will only work if you can compile from the source and set it up manually, which may not be feasible for all.

## Contributing
You can contribute with:

- Bug reports
- Features request

For more information, <a href="https://github.com/mageni/mageni/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">read the contribution guide</a>

Send your bug reports and features request to help@mageni.net

## Thank you, open source
Mageni uses <a href="https://github.com/mageni/mageni/network/dependencies">thousands of open source projects</a> and we thank them with all our hearts. We hope that providing Mageni as an free, open source software will help other people the same way those softwares have helped us and in doing so Mageni is also in strict compliance with the open source licenses. 

Mageni is an important open source contribution to the upstream projects as it provides a moderm web interface and EDA which was really missing to the open source community. Mageni is also a vital contribution to the whole world as it provides a modern vulnerability and attack surface management platform that also was really missing to the global cybersecurity community.
